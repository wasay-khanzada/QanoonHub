# CaseAce - Law Firm Management System
## Resume Points

1. **Developed a full-stack web application** using MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) with RESTful API architecture, implementing 5 core modules including Client Relationship Management (CRM), Case Management, Document Management, Task Management, and Appointment Scheduling with role-based access control for 4 user types (Admin, Partner, Associate, Paralegal, Client).

2. **Implemented real-time communication features** using Socket.io for live case messaging and notifications, with JWT-authenticated WebSocket connections, batch message processing, and room-based chat functionality enabling seamless collaboration between lawyers and clients.

3. **Built secure authentication and authorization system** using JWT tokens with secure HttpOnly cookies, bcrypt password hashing, CORS policies, and middleware-based route protection, ensuring secure access control across different user roles and permissions.

4. **Designed and implemented comprehensive database schema** with MongoDB using Mongoose ODM, managing 7 collections (Users, Cases, Documents, Tasks, Appointments, Messages, Notifications) with complex relationships, supporting features like case applications, billing hours tracking, and document versioning.

5. **Created responsive frontend interface** using React with Tailwind CSS, React Router, React Query for state management, and integrated features including drag-and-drop file uploads, calendar integration, real-time statistics dashboards with Recharts, and notification panels for deadline tracking and appointment reminders.
